### Before and After

This section describes an assignment that involved rebuilding an existing report into a more modern visualization using Tableau.  I talk a little bit about my thought process when I approached the redesign.  A before and after look at the report is included.

### Database Diagram

Here I cover the first OLTP database I designed for production use.  I designed and built all database objects including indexing and stored procedures.  In this section I briefly talk about the project and include a sample schema diagram.

### SQL code sample

Data is never in the perfect format.  OLTP design rarely takes reporting needs into consideration.  In this example, I talk about how I approached an interesting data problem due to how the data was collected in the source system.
